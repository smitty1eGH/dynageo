* Dynageo

  For a given list of data, "DATA", with an id field, "DATA_ID" corresponding to position in the list, implement a geopatial index for DATA as a DynamoDB table.

** Installation

- python -m venv dynageo
- cd dynageo
- . bin/activate
- git clone https://github.com/smitty1eGH/dynageo.git
- cd dynageo
- make reqsInst
- make install

Discussion: we make a virtual environment. Change to that environment directory and activate. 
Check out the project from github, and do into the project directory. 
We can then install the dependencies and install dynageo itself.

** Data Ingest

  We will use data from TIGER
